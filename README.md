# Deep-Generative-Models
This repository explores deep generative models for image reconstruction and latent space learning. It includes implementations of:

* Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs): Constructed using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, experimented with different numbers of mixtures, and evaluated using Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).
* Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Implemented a vanilla VAE for image reconstruction and latent space learning, and developed a Beta-VAE to control image diversity.
* Autoencoders: A vanilla autoencoder was built for compression and feature extraction.
  
The repository provides analysis of the latent space representation, posterior inference for diverse images, and visualizations of the results.
